# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I was able to stay with the pace without feeling overwelmed.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
Bootstrap is actually just a css library and fairly straight-forward to start using it in your projects.

- What are you struggling with?
I'm just trying to keep my fears of falling behind kept in check so that stress doesn't affect my ability to focus and learn. 

- What would you count as a victory?
I've been able to keep up and do well in lab so far!
